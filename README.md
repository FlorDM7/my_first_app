# my_first_app
Trying out Dart and Flutter for the first time! \
Goal: Make a simple to do list app \
Only the code in ./src/lib/ is mine, the rest is generated.

## To be implemented features
- Be able to complete/delete tasks from the list
- Set a deadline for a task (and sort them based on the deadline)
- Categorise certain tasks with a label
- Keep an archive of completed tasks
- Make sure tasks are saved when the app is restarted or closed
